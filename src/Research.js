        Nowadays, we are collecting extremely large datasets. 
        The development of the techniques to analyze data is extremely important. 
        The signature is an infinite sequence characterizing a stream of data up to a certain negligible class. 
        In [], Levin, Lyons and Ni developed a new regression method based on the expected signature of paths. 
        We aim to obtain a non-linear approximation method based on the expected signature of paths. 
        One of the most known and natural appli- cations of the signature method is in quantitative finance, 
        namely analysis of time-series data [7, 16].
